Simple Script Bot to detect IP presence at home Wifi and send mail alarms

Code maintained at http://github/agnunez/ipbot

This is a very simple python script that allows to send an email when a mobile
phone or laptop or any ip device register or disapear on your local Wifi.

It can be use to run other IoT scripts when you or a family member with a 
mobile phone arrives or leave home. (Open garage, switch lights, etc)

The configuration file contains all ip addresses with a nickname of each device
as well as all account details from your wifi, and emails to use for sending
and receiving mails.

Code is selfexplanatory. Some loop delays, number of ping retries and timeouts can also
be defined on the code itself.

Enjoy!
